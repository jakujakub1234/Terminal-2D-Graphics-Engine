# Terminal-2D-Graphics-Engine
Simple graphics engine to run in terminal or cmd (WiP)

You can compile it by running 'make.bat' on Windows (sorry for lack of Makefile, I'll do it). I prepared 4 programms to demonstrate engine's functions:

triangle_animation.cpp:
  Simple animation of a triangle

polygon_animation.cpp:
  Simple animation of a polygon (weird one)
  
plot_function.cpp:
  Plotting sinus and Collatz conjecture
  
pong.cpp:
  2 players pong game (ball leaves a trail)
